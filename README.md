# English-to-French-Translator
This project implements an English-to-French translation model using an encoder-decoder mechanism with LSTM. It demonstrates preprocessing, tokenization, and training on text data to perform sentence translation.


This project demonstrates a neural machine translation model that converts English sentences to French using an encoder-decoder mechanism with LSTMs.

## Key Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and tokenizing text data.
- Encoder-Decoder architecture with LSTMs for sequence-to-sequence learning.
- Supports inference with a trained model for sentence translation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
- A custom dataset containing English-French sentence pairs is used. The dataset is preprocessed before training.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yashdev6116/English-to-French-Translator.git
2. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Python script or notebook for training and inference.

## Output
The model outputs a French translation of the input English sentence.
